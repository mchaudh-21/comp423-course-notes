If it's not main, rename it to main with the following command: git branch -M main. Old versions of git choose the name master for the primary branch, but these days main is the standard primary branch name.</p> <p>(3) Push your local commits to the GitHub repository:</p> <pre><code>git push --set-upstream origin main\n</code></pre> <p>Understanding</p> <p>git push --set-upstream origin main: This command pushes the main branch to the remote repository origin. The --set-upstream flag sets up the main branch to track the remote branch, meaning future pushes and pulls can be done without specifying the branch name and just writing git push origin when working on your local main branch. This long flag has a corresponding -u short flag.</p> <p>(4) Back in your web browser, refresh your GitHub repository to see that the same commit you made locally has now been pushed to remote. You can use git log locally to see the commit ID and message which should match the ID of the most recent commit on GitHub. This is the result of pushing your changes to your remote repository.</p> <p>Reference</p> <p>These instructions are from COMP 423's mkdocs tutorial.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#2-configure-dev-container","title":"2.
